📊 Supermarket-Grocery Sales | Retail Data Analysis Project (EDA)
🔍 Understanding Consumer Behavior through Data

I recently worked on a Retail Analytics Project using a fictional dataset representing grocery orders placed via an app in Tamil Nadu, India. This project helped me explore patterns in sales, discounts, and profits across different regions and cities — and how they impact business decisions.

✅ Project Highlights:
Objective: Analyze sales trends to uncover insights that can drive retail growth.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps Covered:
Data cleaning & preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales & profit analysis by category, sub-category, region, and city
Discount trends & impact on profitability

📈 Key Insights:
* Sales & Discounts: South India showed the highest discount percent and sales, while Central region had the lowest.
* City-level Trends: Krishnagiri and Vellore had strong sales with higher discounts. Trichy saw low sales and discount rates.
* Year-wise Discount Trends: Peak discount-driven sales were observed in 2016; average discount percent remained stable over the years (0.1–0.3).
  
📌 This project gave me hands-on experience with real-world business scenarios in the retail domain, helping sharpen my EDA, visualization, and storytelling skills.

🚀 Excited to keep learning and growing in the field of data analytics!
